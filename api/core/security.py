    # Note: In a real high-load system, initial JWT validation might happen
    #       earlier (e.g., in a gateway/proxy like Nginx/Envoy).
    #       However, backend still often needs to trust/decode for user context.
    #       This simple decoding function extracts potential user_id.
    #       Full user authentication/authorization logic might be more complex,
    #       e.g., checking against an auth service or cache.
    # For this basic implementation, we decode the user_token from the payload directly
    # in the service layer, which is less ideal for the API gateway pattern,
    # but fulfills the requirement of using user_token from VotePayload.
    # A more robust approach would be to use the Authorize header with Bearer token
    # and have a separate mechanism to validate the 'user_token' claim itself
    # within the payload if needed for uniqueness checks.
    # Given the architecture, user uniqueness IS checked async by the worker against PG.
    # The JWT included in the payload is primarily for the worker to validate
    # and derive the user_identifier.

    # As per the request, the user_token is IN THE PAYLOAD, not the Bearer header.
    # The OpenAPI spec also shows BearerAuth for the path, and user_token in payload.
    # This is a potential inconsistency/ambiguity in the spec.
    # For this implementation, we will assume the JWT validation for authentication
    # uses the standard Authorization: Bearer header, but the PAYLOAD's user_token
    # is also validated/used by the worker. The `user_token` in the payload
    # likely contains the same or related user identifier as the token in the header.
    # We will create a dependency to get the token from the PAYLOAD for the service.
